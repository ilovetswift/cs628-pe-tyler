# Input  
The program begins by importing a predefined list of movie objects from a data file. Users interact with the interface by selecting a movie genre from a dropdown menu. This dropdown provides options like Action, Drama, and Comedy, as well as an "All Genres" option to show all available movies.

# Process  
When a genre is selected, the program updates its state using React's `useState` hook. The selected value is passed to a filtering function that checks whether each movie's genre includes the selected genre string (case-insensitive). If "All Genres" is selected or no selection is made, all movies are included in the output list. React re-renders the list automatically based on the filtered result.

# Output  
The filtered list of movies is displayed as individual cards on the web page. Each card shows the movieâ€™s title, genre, and release year. Cards are interactive and styled for clarity and usability.
